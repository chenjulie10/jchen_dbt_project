### CITIBIKE DBT PROJECT
I have created some staging, intermediate and mart models for Citibike data to answer some questions: 
- Which citibike stations are the most popular? (Top 10 stations with the greatest # of trips started)
- What is the average length of citibike trips? 

You can find queries for the dbt models in the Analyses folder. 

Some best practices that I incorporated in the dbt project: 
- Estabishing primary key
- Ensuring deduplication
- Adding tests on columns
