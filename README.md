### CITIBIKE DBT PROJECT
I have created some staging, intermediate and mart models for Citibike data to answer some questions. See Models and Analyses folder.
- What top 10 stations were most popular YoY? (Based on the # of trips started)
- For these popular stations, which months had the most trips?

Some best practices that I incorporated in the dbt project: 
- Estabishing primary key
- Ensuring deduplication
- Adding tests
- Using seeds for mapping
